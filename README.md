You can easily add expansion such as React Hook Form + Components, Storybook, and more just using a single command line.

Check out the [expansion pack repository](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack) for the commands

### App Router Update

Due to App Router update, the expansion pack is currently **outdated**. It will be updated in the future. You can still use them by copy and pasting the files.
