## Get started

1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/megaacheyounes/portfolio-tailwind`
1. install node packages: `yarn` or `npm i`
1. add your information, under folder `src/data` update all files with your data (e.g. personal information, projects, experiences..)
1. replace resume (CV) in the folder `public`, must be PDF with name `resume.pdf` (if file extension or name is different, then update `RESUME_PATH` in `utils/env.ts`)
1. run and test your portfolio: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
1. make a build (to make sure there will be no compilation errors when you deploy): `yarn build` or `npm run build`

##### Analytics (Optional)

If you wish to add analytics, but do not want extensions or browsers to block it, then you can use [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) self hosted Analytics, its a free and open source Analytics tool that you can deploy easily and for free to [vercel](https://vercel.com/) or other Node.js hosting providers.

1. follow Ackee instructions to deploy your analytics platform, for deploying to Vercel see: [Ackee with vercel](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee/blob/master/docs/Get%20started.md#with-vercel)
1. create a domain in your Ackee tool
1. update `src/utils/env.ts` with your Ackee analytics base URL, Ackee script URL and domain ID

**If you do <ins>NOT</ins> which to add Analytics, then set the flag `ENABLE_ANALYTICS` to false, in `src/tools/env.ts`**

## deploy to vercel

Vercel is a free and very convenient platform to publish Next.js projects (Next.js is developed by vercel)

1. create a repo using your github account [github.com/new](https://github.com/new), then add repo link: `git remote add origin <your repo link>`
1. publish the project to your repo: `git push origin master`
1. import your repo in Vercel: [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)

Vercel will automatically run the build script every time you merge into master branch, as well as generating previews when you push to dev branch

## General deployment steps

this project is static, therefor you can deploy it to any web hosting (e.g. Firebase hosting)

1. update next.config.js: set value `output` to `export` (learn more: [vercel docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports))
1. make a build: `yarn build`
1. upload the static files under `/out` (e.i. html, css and js) to your web hosting provider (e.g. Firebase hosting)
